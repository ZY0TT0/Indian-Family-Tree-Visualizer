Purpose of the Project:
The "Indian Family Tree Visualizer" project aims to fill a significant gap in the realm of family tree applications by accommodating the unique complexity of Indian family structures. We observed that many existing family tree software solutions are often designed with a nuclear family model in mind, which fails to capture the extensive and nuanced relationships prevalent in Indian families. Our purpose with this project is to design an application that not only allows for the addition and visualization of a wide array of family members but also identifies and displays intricate relationships, including extended family links like uncles, cousins, and grandparents.
The project will make use of efficient data structures and traversal algorithms to ensure that large family trees with extensive connections are processed smoothly, making the tool both powerful and user-friendly. We are motivated by the desire to create a culturally sensitive application that caters to genealogical research, cultural preservation, and enhanced understanding of family structures in Indian society.

Target Beneficiary:
The project is primarily aimed at users who have a strong interest in:
•	Genealogy: Individuals looking to trace their ancestry and explore family roots will find this application a valuable tool.
•	Cultural Documentation: The app serves those interested in preserving the family history and cultural richness of Indian familial connections.
•	Educational Use: Our target users also include educational institutions that may use this project to teach students about family structure, history, and relationships.
Additionally, this project will benefit researchers, families, and anyone interested in mapping out their lineage or visualizing complex family relationships in an easy-to-understand format.

Project Scope:
The Indian Family Tree Visualizer will allow users to build, expand, and explore a detailed family tree that reflects the unique intricacies of Indian families. Key features include the ability to add family members dynamically, define relationships within the family, and perform relationship queries between individuals. The scope also includes a demonstration of predefined family structures to assist users in understanding the tool’s capabilities. Ultimately, this tool will deliver a valuable asset for genealogists, cultural historians, and individuals interested in documenting their family history.
